# Pac-Man-Clone

Relive the nostalgia of the classic Pacman game, now recreated from scratch using JavaScript! This repository is my personal journey of rebuilding Pacman, capturing the charm of the original arcade game while documenting every stage of the process.

# About the Game
Pacman is a timeless arcade game where players navigate a maze, eat dots, and avoid ghosts. The challenge is to eat all the dots while strategically outmaneuvering the ghosts. Power pellets grant temporary invincibility, allowing Pacman to eat the ghosts for extra points.

# Features
Classic Gameplay: Faithful to the original mechanics with a modern twist.
Dynamic Ghost AI: Challenging ghost behavior inspired by the arcade version.
Responsive Controls: Smooth navigation with keyboard input.
Retro Visuals: Pixelated design that mirrors the classic style.

# Developer’s Journey
This repository is more than just the final product—it's a step-by-step documentation of how I recreated Pacman. Every commit includes detailed descriptions of:
-The features added or updated.
-Challenges faced and how they were solved.
-Reflections on the development process.

#Highlights of the Journey

-Maze Creation: Designing the grid and rendering it dynamically using JavaScript.
-Player Controls: Implementing Pacman’s movement and collision detection.
-Ghost AI: Developing unique movement patterns for each ghost.
-Scoring System: Tracking points, lives, and high scores.
